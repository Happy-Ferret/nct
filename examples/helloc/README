nCrux Configuration Tool (nct) enabled "Hello C" example project.

This example project demonstartes how nCrux configuration tool (nct)
can be leveraged in a C project. This project contains two features
to be turned on or off at compile time.

The generated configuration file ".nct" can be included in Makefile 
to include necessary sources for compilation based on the feature
selection.


Testing the "Hello C" project
=============================

Use following three instructions to test this project.

1. Configure project settings:

   This displays configuration menu in which you can select features and
   set the greet message from each feature to be printed, if turned on.

 	$ nct

2. Compile sources:

   The Makefile has rule to generate C header file based on the configuration
   file ".nct". The nct generates a C header file "src/helloc_nct.h"
   that can be included in C sources code.

	$ make

3. Run the executable:


	$ ./src/helloc

	helloc v0.1.0

	Hello There! nCrux Configuration Tool.

	Hello from Feature2
	$ 



Contents of configuration file generated by nct
===============================================

$ cat .nct
#
# Automatically generated file; DO NOT EDIT.
# Hello C Project
#

#
# Package Information
#
NCT_PKG_NAME="helloc"
NCT_PKG_VER="0.1.0"
# NCT_FEATURE1 is not set
NCT_FEATURE2=y
NCT_FEATURE2_MESSAGE="Hello from Feature2"
$ 

Header file generation
======================

$ nct gen -o src/helloc_nct.h

$ cat src/helloc_nct.h 
/*
 *
 * Automatically generated file using nCrux Configuration Tool (nct).
 * DO NOT EDIT.

 */
#define NCT_PKG_NAME "helloc"
#define NCT_PKG_VER "0.1.0"
#define NCT_FEATURE2 1
#define NCT_FEATURE2_MESSAGE "Hello from Feature2"
