DESCRIPTION
===========
A tool to configure build settings of a project using menu driven interface and to generate corresponding source code to be used in languages like C, Go, Python, PHP, Perl, JavaScript etc. This tool is based on kconfig found in Linux kernel sources.

OPTIONS

menu    Start terminal based menu (classic)

menu-n  Start terminal based menu (new)

menu-g  Start gtk based menu

menu-q  Start Qt based menu

gen     Generate source code

merge   Merge given configuration fragment into base configuration file.

config_file
 File containing current selection of build settings. In case if user saves the modified settings, this file gets overwritten with new settings.

config_source
 Source file for the menu interface. File name "Nconfig" is assumed, if not given.

config_fragment
 File containing partial configuration settings.

output_file
 File to which generated output needs to be writtem. File extension of output_file is recognized and appropriate code is generated. Recognized file extensions are:

  **h**		C source header file

  **xml**	XML file

  **pl**	Perl source file

  **py**	Python source file

  **go**	Golang source file

  **php**	PHP source file

  **rb**	Ruby source file

  **js**	JavaScript source file

========

Load configuration settings from simple.conf if present and display ncurses
based configuration menu based on config_source file Nconfig and write the
changes to simple.conf::

	nconf menu simple.conf
